# OCI Helm Charts Mirror

A private OCI repository for Helm charts used in my homelab environment. This repository serves as a centralised storage solution for Helm charts, ensuring consistent deployments and version control across all my Kubernetes clusters.

## Purpose

- Provides a reliable, self-hosted OCI registry for Helm charts
- Ensures chart availability independent of external repositories
- Simplifies chart version management for homelab infrastructure
- Enables consistent deployments across multiple Kubernetes clusters
